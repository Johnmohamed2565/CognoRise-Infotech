## Project 2: CalculatorApp

### Objective
To develop a basic calculator application that can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features
- User input for two numbers and basic operations
- Basic arithmetic operations like (+,-,*,/)
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

  ### How to Run
1. Compile the `CalculatorApp.java` file:
   ```bash

## Project 3: Student Course Registration System

### Objective
To build a system that allows students to register for courses, manage their registrations, and view available courses.

### Features
- Add and remove courses
- Register and deregister students
- Display course and student information

### How to Run
